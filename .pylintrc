# A comma-separated list of Pylint errors and warnings to disable.
# Add codes here to disable specific warnings that don't apply to your project.

# Tells Pylint not to generate the report section at the end.
# This makes the output cleaner and easier to read.

[TYPECHECK]
# Tells Pylint to check for uninferable members (e.g., from C extensions).
# If you are using libraries with C bindings, set this to False.
# It can help reduce false positives.
